# Website Development

Going through online tutorials on Youtube and [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) has taught me a lot about creating a website, 

I have learnt that in order to create a website, I needed to use:

* HTML

  The basic framework of the website

* CSS

  What you use to make the site look good

* Javascript

  Not used for my website here, but is used making elements fancy, with animations and other bits.



GitHub is being used here to host the website, using the GitHub Desktop App to easily add new content, edit and update the webpages and can even recall previous versions of the website.
