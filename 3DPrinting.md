## 3D Printing



For the assignment, I used Fusion 360 to model the knight chess piece from a 2D artwork.

First, I used GIMP to crop the picture to make the image easier to work with in Fusion.

#### In Fusion 360

First I created a simple round base for the knight.



Using the cropped image as a canvas, I was able to use Point Fit Splines to roughly recreate the shape of the knight.

After extruding the shape and using the Chamfer tool, it looks like this!

<img src="C:\Users\rando\Desktop\Other downloads\knight and canvas.png" alt="knight and canvas" style="zoom:33%;" />

After removing the canvas:

<img src="C:\Users\rando\Desktop\Other downloads\knight done.png" alt="knight done" style="zoom: 33%;" />

Unfortunately, I forgot to record the printing process...

But this is the final outcome after cleanup!
