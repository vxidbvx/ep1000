Inspired by the Shine Bug Creature from the game

They look like this, and come in a variety of colours, including orange, pink and purple

The idea is to have this creature as the light bulb for my flexible lamp.

The lamp will have a flexible neck, made up of many "vertebrae" segments, inspired by

These will be attached to a base which has been laser cut to fit the microcontroller and input devices.
