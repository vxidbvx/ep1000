## Computer Cutting

We did computer cutting using a laser cutter at the FabLab at T11C, affectionately known as the "Dusty Lab". Using Inkscape to create the proper files, we can cut the Plywood board to the correct dimensions.

Some things I have learnt:

- Operation of the laser cutter
- How to quickly resize the models to fit the materials

What I did not expect is that the smell of burnt wood would linger for hours.

I used an extension for Fusion 360 to produce the paths for laser cutting, then used Inkscape to merge them into one file.

Using CorelDraw on the lab computers allows for final adjustments and exporting to the laser cutter itself.
